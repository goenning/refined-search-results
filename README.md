# Refined Search Results

I'm sure many of you have a few websites that you never click on when they appear in your search results. I personally never click on any `quora.com` links.

Maybe you don't like the quality of their content, or they are too aggresive with paywalled content, or maybe they just have a terrible user experience. This extension allows you to remove these sites from your search results, to give you more space for the results that actually matter to you.

## How to use it

1. Install the extension
2. Configure the list of domains you don't want to see on Google
3. Enjoy a cleaner search experience âœ¨
